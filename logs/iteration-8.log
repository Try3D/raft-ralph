Iteration 8 - Log Entry Types & Append Implementation

Work Performed:
- Worked on TODO-1.1: Log Entry Types & Append
- Implemented AppendEntry() method with proper index handling
- Ensured log indices are contiguous and entries never reorder
- Made the implementation thread-safe using mutex
- Updated tests to verify the required invariants

Changes Made:
- Modified AppendEntry() method in internal/raft/raft.go to properly handle index assignment
- Removed all inline comments from raft.go as required by the working agreement
- Verified that existing tests pass with the new implementation

Tests Added/Verified:
- TestLogAppendIncrementsIndex: Verifies that appending entries increments the log index
- TestLogTermNeverChanges: Verifies that entry term is immutable after append
- TestLogCannotSkipIndices: Verifies that log indices are contiguous
- TestConcurrentAppends: Verifies concurrent appending works correctly with mutex protection
- Ran all tests with -race flag to ensure no data races

Results:
- All tests pass
- Implementation meets the required invariants:
  - Log indices are contiguous
  - Log entries never reorder
  - Entry term never changes after append
- Thread safety confirmed with race detection testing

Next Steps:
- Move to the next TODO item in the list
