[2026-01-28T11:55:59.682692] 🚀 Starting iteration 17

--- QWEN OUTPUT START ---
I'll follow the Ralph Wiggum loop and work on iteration 17. Let me first check the current TODO list to understand what I need to work on.

I'll continue with iteration 17, focusing on the next TODO item. Based on the TODO list and the previous work, I need to work on the next uncompleted item. Let me check what needs to be done.

Looking at the TODO list, the next item appears to be related to implementing the leader's functionality for sending AppendEntries to followers (TODO-3.1). Let me first check the current state of the codebase to understand what has been implemented so far.

Now I need to check if there are tests for the "Append Entries as Leader" functionality (TODO-3.1). Let me look at the append_entries_test.go file:

I can see that the tests for "Append Entries as Leader" functionality exist, but I need to check if the actual leader functionality for sending AppendEntries to followers is implemented. Looking at the code, I can see that the leader initialization is done in `handleRequestVoteResponse`, but there's no mechanism for the leader to actively send AppendEntries to followers.

Let me check if there are any tests specifically for leader functionality:

Let me check if there are any other test files related to leader functionality:

I need to implement the leader's functionality for sending AppendEntries to followers. Looking at the current code, I can see that when a node becomes a leader in `handleRequestVoteResponse`, it initializes `NextIndex` and `MatchIndex` arrays, but there's no mechanism to actually send AppendEntries to followers.

Let me implement the leader's AppendEntries sending functionality. First, I'll create a test file for this functionality:
