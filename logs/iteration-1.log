Iteration 1 - Completed TODO-1.1: Robust File-Based Storage Interface

Worked on implementing the Storage interface in internal/storage/storage.go:
- Defined Storage interface with SaveHardState and LoadHardState methods
- Added typed errors: ErrCorrupted and ErrIO
- Ensured all storage operations accept context.Context
- Created comprehensive tests in storage_test.go
- Verified the interface meets the required invariants

Tests:
- Created unit tests for the Storage interface
- Tested SaveHardState and LoadHardState methods
- Verified error handling with custom error types
- Confirmed the interface satisfies the required contract

Results:
- All tests pass
- Project compiles successfully
- Storage interface properly decouples persistence from logic
- All storage operations accept context.Context as required

Learnings/Issues:
- The Storage interface properly separates concerns between Raft logic and persistence
- Using context.Context enables proper cancellation and timeouts
- Custom error types allow for specific error handling strategies
