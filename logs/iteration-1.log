Iteration 1: Completed TODO-0.1: Verify Project Compiles

Work Performed:
- Verified that the project compiles with `go build ./...`
- Found and fixed an unused import in internal/storage/storage.go
- Ran `go vet ./...` to check for issues
- Ran all tests with `go test -race ./...` to ensure no data races
- Verified all existing functionality still works

Results:
- Project compiles cleanly with no errors
- No linting errors found
- All tests pass with race detection enabled
- Unused import "io" was removed from storage.go

Invariants Verified:
- Code compiles cleanly
- No linting errors
