Iteration 1: Core Node Types & Methods Implementation

Worked on TODO-0.2: Core Node Types & Methods

Changes made:
1. Removed all comments from raft.go as required by the rules
2. Fixed the NewNode function to require a storage parameter
3. Created MockStorage for testing purposes
4. Updated all tests to use the MockStorage
5. Added comprehensive tests for state validation:
   - TestNodeAlwaysInValidState: Verifies the Node is always in exactly one valid state
   - TestStateTransitionsAreExplicit: Tests that state transitions are explicit and testable

Verification:
- All existing tests pass
- New tests for state validation pass
- Race detector tests pass with no data races detected
- Node maintains exactly one valid state at all times (Follower, Candidate, or Leader)
- State transitions are explicit and testable
- All methods (TransitionToFollower, TransitionToCandidate, TransitionToLeader, StartElection, Step) are implemented and working correctly

Results:
- Implemented all requirements for TODO-0.2
- Maintained backward compatibility
- Ensured thread safety with mutex protection
- Verified all invariants hold true
