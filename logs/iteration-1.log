Iteration 1: Completed TODO-0.1: Verify Project Compiles

Work Performed:
- Verified that the project compiles with `go build ./...`
- Found and fixed an unused import in internal/storage/storage.go
- Ran `go vet ./...` to check for issues
- Ran all tests with `go test -race ./...` to ensure no data races
- Verified all existing functionality still works

Results:
- Project compiles cleanly with no errors
- No linting errors found
- All tests pass with race detection enabled
- Unused import "io" was removed from storage.go

Invariants Verified:
- Code compiles cleanly
- No linting errors
--- QWEN OUTPUT START ---
I'll follow the Ralph Wiggum loop to work on the first TODO from the list. Let me start by reading the TODO and QWEN files to understand the current state and requirements.

Now I'll start working on the first TODO from the list: TODO-0.1: Verify Project Compiles. Let me check the current project structure and run the necessary commands.

Let me check the go.mod file to understand the project structure:

Now I'll check if there are any existing Go files in the internal/raft directory:

Let me check what's in the raft directory:

Let me examine the existing raft.go and raft_test.go files to understand the current state:

Now I'll run the compilation and vetting commands to verify the project compiles correctly:

# github.com/try3d/raft-ralph/internal/storage
internal/storage/storage.go:8:2: "io" imported and not usedThere's an issue with an unused import in the storage module. Let me check the storage.go file:

I can see that there's an unused import "io" in the storage.go file. Let me fix this:

Now let me run the build command again to verify it compiles:

Great! Now let me run go vet to check for any issues:

Perfect! Now let me run the existing tests to make sure everything is working:

=== RUN   TestStartElectionIncrementsTermAndVotesForSelf
--- PASS: TestStartElectionIncrementsTermAndVotesForSelf (0.00s)
=== RUN   TestStartElectionTransitionsToCandidate
--- PASS: TestStartElectionTransitionsToCandidate (0.00s)
=== RUN   TestStartElectionConcurrent
--- PASS: TestStartElectionConcurrent (0.00s)
PASS
ok  	github.com/try3d/raft-ralph/internal/raft	(cached)Now let me run the race detector to check for any data races:

=== RUN   TestStartElectionIncrementsTermAndVotesForSelf
--- PASS: TestStartElectionIncrementsTermAndVotesForSelf (0.00s)
=== RUN   TestStartElectionTransitionsToCandidate
--- PASS: TestStartElectionTransitionsToCandidate (0.00s)
=== RUN   TestStartElectionConcurrent
--- PASS: TestStartElectionConcurrent (0.00s)
PASS
ok  	github.com/try3d/raft-ralph/internal/raft	1.564sLet me also run tests for the storage package:

=== RUN   TestStorageInterfaceImplementation
    storage_test.go:41: Storage interface is defined
--- PASS: TestStorageInterfaceImplementation (0.00s)
=== RUN   TestSaveHardState
--- PASS: TestSaveHardState (0.00s)
=== RUN   TestLoadHardState
--- PASS: TestLoadHardState (0.00s)
=== RUN   TestStorageErrors
--- PASS: TestStorageErrors (0.00s)
PASS
ok  	github.com/try3d/raft-ralph/internal/storage	1.423sLet me run all tests to make sure everything is working:

ok  	github.com/try3d/raft-ralph/internal/raft	1.153s
ok  	github.com/try3d/raft-ralph/internal/storage	1.258sNow I'll create an iteration log file to document my work:

Now I'll update the TODO.md file to mark the first task as completed:

Now I'll commit the changes:

- Completed TODO-0.1: Verify Project Compiles
- Fixed unused import in internal/storage/storage.go
- Verified project builds and passes all checks

🧪 **Tests**
- Ran `go build ./...` to verify compilation
- Ran `go vet ./...` to check for linting errors
- Ran `go test -race ./...` to verify all tests pass with race detection
- All existing tests continue to pass

📌 **Result**
- Fully working

⚠️ **Learnings / Issues**
- Found an unused import "io" in the storage.go file that needed to be removed
- All existing functionality works as expected after the fix
- Project now compiles cleanly with no errors or warnings
