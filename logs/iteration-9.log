Iteration 9: Vote Persistence Interface Implementation

Work Performed:
- Verified that the Storage interface and FileStorage implementation already existed in internal/storage/storage.go
- Removed all inline comments from internal/raft/raft.go as required by the rules
- Removed all inline comments from internal/storage/storage.go as required by the rules
- Ran comprehensive tests to ensure functionality remains intact

Tests Conducted:
- go test -race ./... - All tests pass with no race conditions
- Verified that vote persistence functionality works correctly
- Confirmed that error handling for corruption detection is maintained
- Validated atomic write operations continue to work properly

Files Modified:
- internal/raft/raft.go (comments removed)
- internal/storage/storage.go (comments removed)

Verification:
- All existing tests continue to pass
- Race detector confirms no data races
- Storage interface properly implements SaveVote and LoadVote methods
- Error types ErrCorrupted and ErrIO are properly defined
- File-based implementation uses atomic writes and checksums for durability
