Iteration 3: Implemented Vote Granting Logic

Worked on TODO-0.5: Vote Granting Logic
- Implemented proper vote granting rules in handleRequestVote function
- Added comprehensive test suite for vote granting behavior:
  - TestSingleVotePerTerm: Ensures node cannot vote twice in same term
  - TestVoteResetOnTermIncrease: Verifies vote resets when term increases
  - TestVotingDifferentCandidates: Prevents voting for multiple candidates in same term
  - TestConcurrentVoteRequests: Tests concurrent vote requests with mutex protection
  - TestVoteGrantingRules: Validates specific conditions for granting votes

All tests pass with race detection enabled.
Code follows Raft specification for vote granting behavior.
