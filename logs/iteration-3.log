Iteration 3 - Vote Persistence Interface Implementation

Work Performed:
- Verified that the Storage interface and error types (ErrCorrupted, ErrIO) were already defined in internal/storage/storage.go
- Removed all inline comments from all test files in internal/raft/ directory as required by the rules
- Ensured no commented-out code blocks remained
- Ran all tests to verify functionality remains intact
- Ran race detection tests to ensure no concurrency issues

Files Modified:
- internal/raft/log_entry_test.go
- internal/raft/raft_test.go
- internal/raft/request_vote_rpc_test.go
- internal/raft/term_monotonicity_test.go
- internal/raft/vote_granting_logic_test.go
- internal/raft/vote_persistence_interface_test.go
- internal/raft/vote_persistence_test.go

Tests:
- All existing tests continue to pass
- Race condition tests pass
- Storage interface tests validate the interface definition and error types

Result:
- Storage interface with SaveVote and LoadVote methods properly defined
- Error types ErrCorrupted and ErrIO properly defined
- All comments removed from code files as required
- Code maintains all functionality and passes all tests
