Iteration 2 - Vote Persistence Interface Implementation

Worked on: TODO-0.4: Vote Persistence Interface

Summary:
- Verified that the Storage interface was already defined in internal/storage/storage.go with the required methods:
  - SaveVote(ctx context.Context, term, votedFor int) error
  - LoadVote(ctx context.Context) (term, votedFor int, err error)
- Identified and removed all inline comments from both internal/raft/raft.go and internal/storage/storage.go files
- Updated the storage test file (internal/storage/storage_test.go) to match the correct interface methods
- Created a new test file internal/raft/vote_persistence_interface_test.go to verify the interface definition
- Ran all tests with -race flag to ensure no data races
- Verified the project compiles correctly

Tests Added/Run:
- TestStorageInterfaceDefinition - verifies MockStorage implements storage.Storage
- TestStorageErrors - verifies error types exist
- Updated all tests in internal/storage/storage_test.go to match the correct interface
- All existing tests continued to pass

Results:
- All tests pass
- No data races detected
- Project compiles successfully
- Storage interface properly defined with required error types (ErrCorrupted, ErrIO)

Invariants Maintained:
- Storage is decoupled from consensus logic
- All I/O goes through interface
- Error types are properly defined with context wrapping
