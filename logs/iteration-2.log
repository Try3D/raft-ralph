Iteration 2: Implemented Term Monotonicity Tests and Fixed Concurrency Issues

Work Performed:
- Implemented comprehensive test suite for term monotonicity as specified in TODO-0.3
- Created term_monotonicity_test.go with tests covering:
  - TestTermNeverDecreases: Verifies currentTerm never decreases
  - TestHigherTermForcesFollower: Tests that higher term messages force follower state
  - TestTermUpdateWithMessage: Tests that receiving higher-term message updates local term
  - TestMultipleConcurrentMessages: Tests concurrent messages with multiple goroutines
  - TestLowerTermMessageDoesNotChangeTerm: Tests that lower/equal term messages don't change term
- Identified and fixed data races in the Node implementation by adding mutex protection
- Updated all Node methods to be thread-safe using sync.RWMutex

Testing Results:
- All tests pass without race conditions
- Race detector confirms no data races exist
- Verified term monotonicity invariants are maintained
- Concurrent operations work correctly

Files Modified:
- /Users/rsaran/Projects/raft/internal/raft/raft.go: Added mutex and made methods thread-safe
- /Users/rsaran/Projects/raft/internal/raft/term_monotonicity_test.go: Added comprehensive term monotonicity tests

Verification:
- go test -v ./internal/raft/... : All tests pass
- go test -race -v ./internal/raft/... : All tests pass with no race conditions
