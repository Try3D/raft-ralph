Iteration 2 - Vote Persistence Interface Implementation

Work Performed:
- Verified that the Storage interface is properly defined in internal/storage/storage.go with required methods:
  - SaveVote(ctx context.Context, term, votedFor int) error
  - LoadVote(ctx context.Context) (term, votedFor int, err error)
- Verified that the storage package defines the required error types:
  - ErrCorrupted
  - ErrIO
- Verified that the existing tests in vote_persistence_interface_test.go properly validate the interface
- Removed all inline comments from internal/raft/raft.go as required by the working agreement
- Ran all tests to ensure functionality remains intact
- Ran race condition tests to ensure thread safety

Files Modified:
- /Users/rsaran/Projects/raft/internal/raft/raft.go (removed inline comments)

Tests Executed:
- TestStorageInterfaceDefinition - verifies interface compliance
- TestStorageErrors - verifies error types exist
- All existing tests in the raft package to ensure no regression
- Race condition tests with -race flag

Results:
- All tests pass
- No data races detected
- Storage interface properly defined with required methods and error types
- Code follows Go industry best practices
- Comments successfully removed from raft.go as required
