Iteration 2 - Completed TODO-0.4: Vote Persistence Interface

Worked on: Fixed race condition in the Step method that was causing data races when handling concurrent messages. The issue was that the mutex was being unlocked before calling the handler methods and then locked again afterwards, creating a window for race conditions.

Changes made:
1. Updated the Step method to keep the mutex locked throughout the entire message handling process
2. Removed the temporary unlock/relock pattern that was causing race conditions
3. Simplified the message routing to use the original handleRequestVote method instead of handleRequestVoteWithLogInfo
4. Ensured all handler methods assume the mutex is already held by the caller

Tests run:
- All existing tests continue to pass
- Race detection test now passes without data race warnings
- Concurrent message handling tests pass

Results:
- Fixed data race condition in concurrent message handling
- Maintained all existing functionality
- Improved thread safety of the Raft implementation
