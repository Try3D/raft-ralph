Iteration 2 - Completed TODO-0.2: Add StartElection Test Suite

Work performed:
- Created internal/raft/raft_test.go
- Added TestStartElectionIncrementsTermAndVotesForSelf() test
- Added TestStartElectionTransitionsToCandidate() test  
- Added TestStartElectionConcurrent() test with 5 goroutines
- Used sync.WaitGroup to coordinate goroutines
- Used sync.Mutex to protect shared state access during concurrent tests

Test results:
- All tests pass: TestStartElectionIncrementsTermAndVotesForSelf, TestStartElectionTransitionsToCandidate, TestStartElectionConcurrent
- Race detection tests pass with no data races detected
- Build succeeds with go build ./...

Invariants verified:
- Election always starts in a new term (term incremented)
- Node votes for itself when election starts
- Concurrent calls to StartElection maintain invariants
- No data races detected with go test -race

- Completed TODO-0.2: Added StartElection Test Suite
- Created internal/raft/raft_test.go with three tests

🧪 **Tests**
- Added TestStartElectionIncrementsTermAndVotesForSelf(): Verifies term increment and self-voting
- Added TestStartElectionTransitionsToCandidate(): Verifies state transition to Candidate
- Added TestStartElectionConcurrent(): Tests concurrent election calls with sync.WaitGroup and sync.Mutex
- All tests pass, including race detection with `go test -race -count=10`

📌 **Result**
- Fully working

⚠️ **Learnings / Issues**
- Had to remove unused variable 'initialVotedFor' to get clean compilation
- The existing StartElection method in raft.go already implemented the required behavior correctly
- Concurrent test showed that the implementation handles multiple election attempts safely
- All Raft invariants for this TODO are properly enforced by the tests
