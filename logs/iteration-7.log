Iteration 7: Log Entry Types & Append Implementation

Work Performed:
- Implemented TODO-1.1: Log Entry Types & Append
- Modified LogEntry struct to include Index field
- Updated AppendEntry method to properly assign indices when appending entries
- Updated GetLastLogIndexAndTerm method to return the actual index from the log entry
- Created comprehensive test suite in log_entry_test.go:
  - TestLogAppendIncrementsIndex: Verifies that appending entries increments the log index
  - TestLogTermNeverChanges: Verifies that entry term is immutable after append
  - TestLogCannotSkipIndices: Verifies that log indices are contiguous
  - TestConcurrentAppends: Tests concurrent appending of entries with sync.WaitGroup
  - TestAppendEntryWithWrongTerm: Tests that AppendEntry fails when term doesn't match

Tests Results:
- All new tests pass
- Race detector passes with -race flag
- All existing tests continue to pass
- Build succeeds with go build ./...
- Log indices are now properly maintained and contiguous
- Entry terms remain immutable after append

Invariants Verified:
- Log indices are contiguous (0, 1, 2, ...)
- Log entries never reorder
- Entry term never changes after append
- AppendEntry only adds entries when term matches current term
