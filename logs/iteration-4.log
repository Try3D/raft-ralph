Iteration 4: File-Based Vote Storage Implementation

Work Performed:
- Implemented file-based storage implementation with atomic writes
- Added fsync() for durability after every write
- Implemented CRC32 checksums to detect corruption
- Handled partial writes and corruption gracefully
- Created comprehensive test suite including:
  - TestVotePersistsAcrossRestart - verifies votes persist across restarts
  - TestCorruptionDetection - verifies corruption is detected
  - TestAtomicWrites - verifies concurrent writes don't corrupt state
  - TestSaveVote - basic save functionality
  - TestLoadVoteDefaultValues - handles non-existent files correctly
  - TestStorageErrors - error handling
  - TestConcurrentAccess - concurrent access safety

Technical Details:
- Used atomic file writes with temporary files and renames
- Used fsync() on both the file and parent directory for durability
- Implemented checksum verification to detect corruption
- Used mutex to protect concurrent access to the same storage instance

Testing Results:
- All tests pass with race detection enabled
- No data races detected
- All edge cases handled properly (missing files, corruption, concurrent access)
- Error handling works correctly

Invariant Verification:
- Data is durable after write returns (verified with fsync)
- Corruption is detected on load (verified with checksums)
- No data loss on crashes (atomic writes ensure this)
