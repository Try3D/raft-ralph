Iteration 6 - File-Based Vote Storage Implementation

Worked on implementing the file-based vote storage functionality as defined in TODO-0.6:
- Integrated the existing FileStorage implementation with the Raft node
- Updated the handleRequestVote function to persist votes when granted
- Updated the StartElection function to persist self-votes
- Updated the Step function to persist state when transitioning to follower on higher-term messages
- Created a NewNodeFromStorage function to load node state from storage
- Implemented comprehensive tests for vote persistence across restarts
- Verified corruption detection works properly
- Ensured atomic writes work correctly with concurrent operations
- Ran all tests with race detection enabled to ensure thread safety

Tests added:
- TestVotePersistsAcrossRestart: Verifies votes persist across node restarts
- TestVotePersistenceOnRequestVote: Verifies votes are persisted when granting to others
- TestVotePersistenceOnHigherTerm: Verifies votes are reset and persisted on higher-term messages
- TestCorruptionDetection: Verifies storage correctly detects corruption
- TestAtomicWrites: Verifies concurrent writes don't corrupt state

All tests pass with race detection enabled, confirming the implementation is correct and thread-safe.

I'll follow the Ralph Wiggum loop and work on the next TODO from the list. Let me first check the current TODO list to understand what I need to work on.

Based on the TODO list, I need to work on the next uncompleted item. Looking at the list, I can see that TODO-0.2 (Core Node Types & Methods) appears to be the next item that needs implementation, as it's listed after the completed TODO-0.1. Let me check the current state of the code to understand what has been implemented so far.

Let me check the current state of the raft package to see what has been implemented:

Let me check the current raft.go file to understand the current implementation:

Now I'll check the storage package to see what's been implemented there:

Let me check the current test files to understand what has been tested so far:

Let me check the other test files to get a complete picture:

Now I'll check the log_entry_test.go file:

Now I need to check if there are any comments in the raft.go file that need to be deleted according to the rules:

255:	// Only append if the entry's term matches the current term
260:	// Append the entry to the log
270:		return -1, -1 // Indicate empty log
273:	// Last index is length - 1 (since indices are 0-based)I need to remove the inline comments from the raft.go file as per the requirements. Let me update the file to remove these comments:

Now I'll check if there are any remaining comments in the file:

Perfect! All comments have been removed from the raft.go file. Now I need to work on the next TODO item. Looking at the TODO list, I can see that TODO-0.2 (Core Node Types & Methods) appears to have already been partially implemented based on the code I saw. Let me check if there are any missing elements from that TODO.

Looking at the TODO-0.2 specification:
- Define `Node` struct with persistent state
- Implement `TransitionToFollower()`, `TransitionToCandidate()`, `TransitionToLeader()`
- Implement `StartElection()` - increments term, votes for self, becomes candidate
- Implement `Step()` - main message handler that routes to sub-handlers
- Verify `Node` maintains exactly one valid state at all times

Looking at the code, I can see that these methods are already implemented. So I should move to the next uncompleted TODO. The next one appears to be TODO-0.6: File-Based Vote Storage Implementation.

Let me check if there's anything else I need to implement for the current phase. Looking more carefully at the TODO list, I notice that the current implementation may be missing some aspects of the vote persistence integration with the Node. Let me check if there are any tests for TODO-0.6 that might indicate what's missing:

Based on the TODO list, I need to work on TODO-0.6: File-Based Vote Storage Implementation. This involves:
- Implementing the Storage interface using atomic file writes
- Using fsync() for durability after every write
- Implementing CRC32 checksums to detect corruption
- Handling partial writes and corruption gracefully
- Writing persistence tests

Looking at the code, I can see that the FileStorage implementation is already in the storage package. Let me check if the Node properly integrates with the Storage interface for saving votes.

Let me look at the handleRequestVote function to see if it's properly saving votes to storage:

In the current code, I can see that the handleRequestVote function grants votes but doesn't seem to save them to storage. Let me update the code to properly integrate with the storage system:

I need to remove the comments I accidentally added:

I need to remove those empty blocks too:

Now let me also update the StartElection method to save the vote when a node votes for itself:

Let me also update the TransitionToFollower method to save the vote when resetting:

I need to remove that empty condition:

Now I need to create tests for the vote persistence functionality as required by TODO-0.6. Let me create a new test file for vote persistence tests:

Now let me run the tests to make sure everything works correctly:

FAILI see there are some test failures. The issue is that when I create a new node from storage, I'm not loading the vote from storage. I need to update the NewNodeWithState function to load the vote from storage. Let me fix this:

Wait, there's an issue with my approach. The NewNodeWithState function is supposed to initialize with the provided persistentState, but I'm overriding it with values from storage. That's not correct. Let me think about this differently.

Actually, I think the issue is that I need to create a function that loads a node from storage, not just from a provided persistent state. Let me create a proper function to load a node from storage:

Now I need to update the test to use the new function:

Now let me run the tests again to see if they pass:

- All existing tests continue to pass
- All tests pass with race detection enabled

📌 **Result**
- Fully working: File-based vote storage with proper persistence and recovery

⚠️ **Learnings / Issues**
- Had to implement a NewNodeFromStorage function to properly load state from storage
- Needed to ensure all state changes (elections, vote grants, term updates) are persisted to storage
- Race conditions were properly handled with mutex protection
- The implementation correctly handles corruption detection and atomic writes

--- QWEN OUTPUT START ---
I'll follow the Ralph Wiggum loop and work on the next TODO from TODO.md. Let me start by checking what the current TODO is.

Now I'll check the current iteration log to see what was completed in the previous iteration:

I'll continue working on the next TODO item according to the Ralph Wiggum loop. Based on the TODO list, I need to work on TODO-2.1: Election Timeout & Tick Mechanism. Let me first check the current state of the codebase and implement this functionality.

I need to implement the Tick method for election timeout counter. Let me first check the current Node struct to understand what fields are already there:

I can see that the Node struct already has `ElectionTimeoutCounter` and `RandomizedElectionTimeout` fields. Now I need to implement the Tick method and the election timeout logic. Let me add the Tick method to the Node struct:

Now I need to update the constructor functions to initialize the random election timeout. Let me update the NewNode function:

Now I need to update the NewNode function to initialize the random election timeout:

Now I need to update the other constructor functions as well:

Now I need to update the NewNodeFromStorage function:

Now I need to update the Step function to reset the election timeout counter when receiving AppendEntries (heartbeat) or other messages from the leader:

Now I need to update the handleRequestVote function to reset the election timeout when receiving a RequestVote message:

Now I need to create a test file for the election timeout functionality:

[API Error: <5000202> InternalError.Algo.ModelServingError.ModelServingUnknownError: An error occurred in model serving.
