Iteration 6 - File-Based Vote Storage Implementation

Worked on implementing the file-based vote storage functionality as defined in TODO-0.6:
- Integrated the existing FileStorage implementation with the Raft node
- Updated the handleRequestVote function to persist votes when granted
- Updated the StartElection function to persist self-votes
- Updated the Step function to persist state when transitioning to follower on higher-term messages
- Created a NewNodeFromStorage function to load node state from storage
- Implemented comprehensive tests for vote persistence across restarts
- Verified corruption detection works properly
- Ensured atomic writes work correctly with concurrent operations
- Ran all tests with race detection enabled to ensure thread safety

Tests added:
- TestVotePersistsAcrossRestart: Verifies votes persist across node restarts
- TestVotePersistenceOnRequestVote: Verifies votes are persisted when granting to others
- TestVotePersistenceOnHigherTerm: Verifies votes are reset and persisted on higher-term messages
- TestCorruptionDetection: Verifies storage correctly detects corruption
- TestAtomicWrites: Verifies concurrent writes don't corrupt state

All tests pass with race detection enabled, confirming the implementation is correct and thread-safe.
