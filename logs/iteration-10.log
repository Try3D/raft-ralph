Iteration 10 - Wed Jan 28 12:16:42 EST 2026

Worked on: TODO-1.2: Request Vote RPC Full Behavior
- Updated handleRequestVote to check log term/index for candidate log comparison
- Implemented proper log comparison logic: grant vote only if candidate log is at least as up-to-date as ours
- Log is considered up-to-date if: (candidate's log term > our log term) OR (candidate's log term == our log term AND candidate's log index >= our log index)
- Created comprehensive tests covering:
  - TestVoteGrantedIfLogUpToDate: candidate with more up-to-date log gets vote
  - TestVoteDeniedIfLogOutOfDate: candidate with older log denied
  - TestLogComparisonByTerm: term takes precedence over index
  - TestConcurrentVoteComparison: multiple nodes comparing logs concurrently

Tests: All tests pass including race detection
- Verified data races with go test -race
- All existing tests continue to pass
- New tests verify log comparison behavior

Result: Fully working implementation of Request Vote RPC with proper log comparison logic according to Raft specification

Learnings/Issues:
- Had to carefully handle mutex locking to avoid deadlocks between Step() and GetLastLogIndexAndTerm()
- Needed to restructure the code to prevent recursive lock acquisition
- Fixed test scenarios to accurately reflect Raft voting rules (can only vote once per term)[2026-01-28T10:41:47.501694] ❌ qwen TIMEOUT (10 min)
