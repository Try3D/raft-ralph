Iteration 2 - Completed TODO-0.2: Add StartElection Test Suite

Work Performed:
- Created internal/raft/raft_test.go
- Added TestStartElectionIncrementsTermAndVotesForSelf() test
- Added TestStartElectionTransitionsToCandidate() test
- Added TestStartElectionConcurrent() test with 5 goroutines
- Used sync.WaitGroup to coordinate goroutines
- Used sync.Mutex to protect shared state access during concurrent tests

Tests Results:
- All tests pass
- Race detector passes with -race flag
- Ran 10 iterations of concurrent tests with no issues
- Build succeeds with go build ./...
- All tests pass with go test ./...

Invariants Verified:
- Election always starts in a new term (term incremented)
- Node votes for itself when election starts
- Concurrent calls to StartElection maintain invariants
- No data races detected with go test -race[2026-01-28T09:50:45.237577] ✅ Git user.email check SUCCESS
