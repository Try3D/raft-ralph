Iteration 24 - Vote Persistence Interface Implementation

Worked on TODO-0.4: Vote Persistence Interface

Summary:
- Verified that the Storage interface with SaveVote and LoadVote methods was already defined in internal/storage/storage.go
- Removed all comments from internal/raft/raft.go as required by the rules
- Fixed compilation errors related to duplicate function definitions and unused variables
- Ran tests to verify the storage interface works correctly

The Storage interface includes:
- SaveVote(ctx context.Context, term, votedFor int) error
- LoadVote(ctx context.Context) (term, votedFor int, err error)
- Error types: ErrCorrupted, ErrIO

Tests passed:
- TestStorageInterfaceDefinition
- TestStorageErrors

This completes the implementation of the vote persistence interface as required by TODO-0.4.
