Iteration 26: Vote Persistence Interface Implementation

Worked on: TODO-0.4: Vote Persistence Interface

Summary:
- Verified that the Storage interface is properly defined in internal/storage/storage.go
- Interface includes SaveVote and LoadVote methods as required
- Error types ErrCorrupted and ErrIO are properly defined
- Removed all comments from internal/raft/raft.go as per requirements
- Ran tests to verify the implementation works correctly

Files Modified:
- internal/raft/raft.go (removed comments)
- internal/storage/storage.go (already implemented)
- internal/raft/vote_persistence_interface_test.go (verified existing tests)

Tests:
- TestStorageInterfaceDefinition: Verifies the interface definition
- TestStorageErrors: Verifies error types exist
- All storage tests pass including persistence, corruption detection, and atomic writes

Result: Completed successfully - Vote persistence interface is properly defined and tested
