[2026-01-28T11:48:54.814481] ITERATION 15
[2026-01-28T11:48:54.814671] ============================================================
[2026-01-28T11:48:54.815125] 🚀 Starting iteration 15

--- QWEN OUTPUT START ---
I'll follow the Ralph Wiggum loop and work on the next TODO from the list. Let me first check the current TODO list to see what iteration 15 should focus on.

Based on the TODO list, I need to work on the next item in sequence. Looking at the list, I can see that TODO-0.3 (Term Monotonicity Tests) is marked as completed. So the next item to work on is:

TODO-0.4: Vote Persistence Interface
- Define `Storage` interface: `SaveVote(ctx context.Context, term, votedFor int) error` and `LoadVote(ctx context.Context) (term, votedFor int, err error)`
- Create typed errors: `ErrCorrupted`, `ErrIO`
- Define error wrapping patterns with context
- NO implementation yet - interface only

Let me first check the current files to understand the structure and delete any comments as required by the rules.

I need to check the current raft.go file to see what's already implemented and to remove any comments before proceeding.

I notice that there's already a Storage interface being referenced in the code, but I need to check the storage package to see if the interface is defined there. Let me check the storage directory:

Let me check the storage.go file to see the current implementation:

I can see that the Storage interface and its implementation already exist in the storage package. Since the TODO-0.4 is about defining the Storage interface and creating typed errors, and I can see that's already been implemented, I need to check if there are any comments in the code that need to be deleted according to the rules.

Let me check for any comments in the raft.go file:

Looking at the raft.go file I read earlier, I don't see any inline comments that need to be removed. The code appears to follow the requirements already. Since TODO-0.4 is about defining the interface which is already done, I should move to the next logical step.

Wait, I need to carefully read the requirements again. The task is to work on the next TODO in order, which is TODO-0.4. Even though the implementation exists, I need to make sure all comments are removed and verify the implementation meets the requirements.

Let me check if there are any comments in the storage.go file:

Let me also check the raft.go file for any comments:

Good, there are no inline comments in the files. Now I need to work on the next item in the TODO list, which is implementing the Vote Persistence Interface. Although the interface exists, I need to make sure it's properly implemented according to the specification and write tests for it.

Let me check if there are any tests for the vote persistence interface:

The vote persistence interface test already exists. Since the TODO-0.4 is about defining the Storage interface and creating typed errors, and I can see that's already implemented in the storage package, I believe this task is already completed. 

Let me check if there are any other files related to vote persistence that I should examine:

Based on my review, I can see that the vote persistence interface (TODO-0.4) has already been implemented and tested. The Storage interface is defined in the storage package with the required methods and error types. The tests for vote persistence are also already in place.

Since this task is already completed, I should move to the next item in the TODO list. The next item appears to be TODO-0.5: Vote Granting Logic. But first, let me make sure I understand the current state correctly.

Looking back at the TODO list, I see that:
- TODO-0.3: Term Monotonicity Tests is marked as completed
- TODO-0.4: Vote Persistence Interface should be completed based on my inspection
- TODO-0.5: Vote Granting Logic is the next item

Let me check if there are already tests for vote granting logic:

I can see that the vote granting logic tests (TODO-0.5) have also already been implemented. Let me continue checking the next item in the TODO list, which would be TODO-0.6: File-Based Vote Storage Implementation.

Let me check if that's already implemented by looking for related tests:

I can see that the file-based vote storage implementation and its tests (TODO-0.6) are already implemented as well. Let me check the next item in the TODO list, which would be Phase 1: Log Structure, starting with TODO-1.1: Log Entry Types & Append.

Let me check if that's already implemented:

I can see that the log entry tests (TODO-1.1) are also already implemented. Let me continue to check the next item in the list, which would be TODO-1.2: Request Vote RPC Full Behavior.

[API Error: <5000202> InternalError.Algo.ModelServingError.ModelServingUnknownError: An error occurred in model serving. The error message it sent us is [{"request_id":"1476d106-5cba-424e-8b7a-a6018c24f1ff","service_id":"v-d47ed302","status_code":503,"status_name":"ServiceUnavailable","status_message":"Too many requests.
